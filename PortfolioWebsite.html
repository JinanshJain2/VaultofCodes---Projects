            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <h3>Netlify:</h3>

            <p>Netlify is a web developer platform that multiplies productivity By unifying the elements of the
                modern decoupled web, from local development to advanced edge logic, Netlify enables a 10x faster
                path to much more performance, secure, and scalable websites and apps. Our bet on the Jamstack is
                quickly coming true. The web is rapidly changing away from monolithic to decoupled apps, and web
                developers are storming ahead with more power than ever. Netlify is built to cater to that movement,
                and in just a few years we’ve on-boarded millions of developers and businesses, and are building and
                serving millions of web projects daily around the globe. Fun fact: in the time it took you to read the
                above, Netlify served over 600,000 requests.</p>

               <p> ADVANTAGES:
                ● Netlify Is Less Expensive, and You Get a Faster Site.
                ● Netlify Build Enables Developers to Build With Any Integration.
                ● It's Easier to Launch a Site Using Netlify.</p>

                <p>DISADVANTAGES:

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <h3>API Key:</h3>
            <p>API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a software
                intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other APIs unlock a door
                to software (or web-based data), in a way that is controlled and safe for the program.
                Code can then be entered that sends requests to the receiving software, and data
                can be returned. A clear example of this in action is the Google Maps API
                Chat Engine is an API which makes it easy to build chat services. Building a chat
                from scratch takes a lot of time, code, and is expensive. It's better to use a product
                instead of writing it from scratch. We make it easy to build your chat idea in minutes.</p>

               <p>FEATURES:
                • Authenticate user
                • Subscribe (connect) to incoming chats and messages
                • Create chats and messages
                • Add and remove people from chats
                • Edit and delete chat and message data.</p>

                <p> OBJECT:
                • id (int) - Unique primary key to identify this chat
                • admin (String) - Unique username of the person who created this chat
                • title (String) - Optional title of this chat
                • created (Datetime) - Date-time of chat creation
                • people (Array) - Array of people added to this chat</p>

                <p>MESSAGE OBJECT:
                •
                • id (int) - Unique primary key to identify this message
                • sender (String) - Unique username of the person who sent this message
                • text (String) - Contents of the message sent
                • created (Datetime) - Date-time of message creation</p>

                <p>WORKING OF API KEY
                An application programming interface key (API key) is a unique code that
                is passed in to an API to identify the calling application or user. API keys
                are used to track and control how the API is being used, for example to
                prevent malicious use or abuse of the API. The API key often acts as both
                a unique identifier and a secret token for authentication, and is assigned a
                set of access that is specific to the identity that is associated with it.</p>
